why did I take this class?
I took this class because I just need a few more credits in order to offically graduate

what are a few things I hope to learn?
I am hoping I will be able to actually follow this class and not get too confused, as this is something that is completely out of my comfort zone

The image file I upleaded is a photo of my at my graduation party that my sister took. I walked at graduation on May 13 and am very excieted to offically be done with school!
