    <p>she was broken<br />
      but somehow<br />
      she found peace<br />
      in the pieces<br />
      scattered across<br />
      the floor<br />
      she's an artist in the way<br />
      she pieces herself<br />
      back together<br />
      to create something stronger<br />
      and a bit more beautiful<br />
      than before<br />
